       I was born on July 8th, 1988 in Pequannock, New Jersey. Pequannock is a
       small town in Northern New Jersey with a poplution of 13,888. I attended
       a Catholic Elementary School from Pre-K through 4th grade. For 5th grade,
       I had decided to make the switch to the townships public middle school,
       Pequannock Valley, for grades 5-8. Upon graduation middle school,
       I had decided to continue with public education at Pequannock Highschool,
       for grades 9-12. Switching from a small catholic school into the larger
       public education system provided me with better social skills more friendships
       than if I had stayed in the catholic school.
       <br><br>
       Up next was COLLEGE!!!! I decided to attend Marist College in Poughkeepsie,
       NY. After being accepted into the Business School, I determined that
       I wanted a concentration in both Finance and Marketing. My first job out
       of school was at an Investment Bank. After three years at the bank, I
       realized that banking was not for me so I decided to see what the Insurance
       world had to offer. After two years of being an insurance broker, I took
       notice that the previous two jobs were more or less being a paper pushing
       between clients and vendors. Not being thrilled with this, I began to
       have an interest in programming. Which is why I am currently enrolled in
       the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp at the Jersey City location.
